			 <h2>Returns/Refund/Cancellation Policy</h2>
			<p>Any PNR or itinerary receipt may be returned up to a year after the date of travel.
</p>
<p>Charges and fares must be paid to the carrier in any accepted currency. 
Cancellation fee: The exchange rate used when paying with a different type of currency than the one used to calculate the fare depends on the rules and restrictions of the bank, the credit card provider, and the carrier. Tickets that have been purchased and processed refunds may also be subject to these rules.
</p>
<h3>If you want additional information about your American flight cancellation, you can read it here:</h3>

<p>We welcome your inquiries related to American applications and will be happy to assist you.</p>

<p>We have a call centre that is open every day of the week. We are reachable. You could also send us an email instead. Every email will receive a response from us within 48 hours.</p>

<p>American cancellation policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>The percentage of the return you receive may vary depending on American policy, the justification for your refund request, and the amount of time between the date of your request and the date of your departure.</li>
<li>All airline refunds and future credits are subject to the fare limitations, policies, and procedures of each airline.</li>
<li>On the payment page, service costs will be converted into the currency of your nation.</li>
<li>Adults, children, elders, infants, students, and the military are all different categories of passengers.</li>
<li>Service charges will be applied to all changes, refunds, cancellations, and future credits per person and per ticket.</li>
<li>All post-ticketing fees, like our transaction service fees (booking fees), are not refundable and could vary at any time.</li>
<li>Any fees and charges levied by airlines or other suppliers are in addition to our fees.</li>
<li>Government fees and taxes might be changed at any time.</li>
<li>Your account will only be charged the final total price that our salesperson has displayed or discussed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is the American Airlines cancellation policy? Let's discuss here:</h3>

<p><b>1. There are refund policies for the majority of our airline tickets. Only available if our travel suppliers' cancellation and refund policies are in effect and your refund request has been granted.</b><p>

<p>You are not considered a no-show if we are able to secure waivers from the providers to handle this desired cancellation and refund (most no-show bookings are ineligible for any waiver from suppliers for refund processing).</p>

<p><b>2. A large percentage of our airline tickets are not refundable.</b></p>

<p>The limitations, rules, guidelines, and procedures that apply to airline fares also apply to airline refunds and future credits.
</p>
<p><b>3. Particular Services</b></p>

<p>All Special Services, accessible only upon request, are subject to each airline's inspection and approval process as well as its fare restrictions, policies, and procedures. The payment of Special Service Fees will be made at the time the service is provided, and they will only be reimbursed if the request is denied by the Airlines.</p>

<h3>Special circumstances to look for:</h3>

<h3>Incorrect name</h3>

<p>There is a discrepancy between the name on the passenger's airline ticket and the names on their passport or any other form of recognised government identification.</p>

<h3>Visa/Passport</h3>

<p>A letter of denial for a passport or visa is usually needed in order to process a request.</p>

<h3>Baggage</h3>

<p>Please save all receipts and luggage tags.</p>

<h3>In the case of absence during a flight</h3>

<p>You'll have to present proof demonstrating why you were unable to depart on time.</p>

<h3>Resisted boarding</h3>

<p>For your scheduled departure, you will be required to show documentation of the reason you were denied boarding.</p>

<h3>Duplicate Tickets</h3>

<p>Copies of all tickets with the exact same itineraries as those reserved with us are required in order to submit a refund request.</p><br><br><br>
